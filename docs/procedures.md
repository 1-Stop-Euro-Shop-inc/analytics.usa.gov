This document is to memorialize internal project procedures.  Other agencies or teams not at GSA are free to adopt them as well, but don't have to in order to use the software.  

### Cloud.gov Access 

The System owner and current project developers need cloud.gov access to analytics.usa.gov.  The system owner (currently Gray Brooks) manages this access, granting access to new project developers when they come onboard and removing access when they leave.  

Specifically, current developers are [granted](https://cloud.gov/docs/apps/managing-teammates/) OrgManager rights to `gsa-opp-analytics` and SpaceDeveloper rights to each of the projects spaces.
